## Preprocessing
None at the moment. Sections and subsections are appended directly to each line as they appear in the text. 

In the future, if required, it will be trivial to perform subsection-level preprocessing such as removing ordered list numbers (i.e. (a)(b)(c)(i)(ii)(iii)) etc. 

Furthermore, the html form of the legislation is organized into classes based on section level. It should be relatively simple to modify this script to represent each piece of legislation as a tree if required. 

## TODO
- To also scrape Union laws without parallel translations.
- Stop ignoring SSL certificate verification if possible
